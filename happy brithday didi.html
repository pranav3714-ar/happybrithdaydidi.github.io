		<p>To my dear didi on her special day,<br>
			I know this gift comes a little late,<br>
			But please accept my heartfelt apologies,<br>
			And know that my love for you never abates.<br>
			<br>
			You have always been there for me,<br>
			Through thick and thin, you've lent a hand,<br>
			Your love and support have meant the world,<br>
			And helped me reach where I stand.<br>
			<br>
			Your wisdom and guidance are a treasure,<br>
			That I cherish with all my heart,<br>
			You've shown me the way when I'm lost,<br>
			And helped me make a fresh start.<br>
			<br>
			So, on your birthday, dear didi,<br>
			I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart,<br>
			For all the love and care you've given me,<br>
			And for being my guiding star.<br>
			<br>
			I may be late with this small gift,<br>
			But it comes with love and gratitude,<br>
			For all the ways you've touched my life,<br>
			And for being the sister I've always pursued.<br>
			<br>
			Happy Birthday, dear didi,<br>
			May all your dreams come true,<br>
			And may you be blessed with love and happiness,<br>
			In all that you say and do.</p>
